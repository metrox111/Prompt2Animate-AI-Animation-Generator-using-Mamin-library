## ⚙️ How It Works

1. 📝 **Enter a Prompt**  
   Example: _"Explain Newton's Laws of Motion"_

2. 🧠 **Prompt → Python Code**  
   The prompt is sent to a language model (via OpenAI API) which generates a full Manim (Python) animation script.

3. 🖥️ **Code Execution**  
   The generated Manim code is run in the backend no coding required from the user.

4. 🎬 **Video Output**  
   Manim renders the animation as a high-quality video.

5. 👁️ **Video Preview**  
   The final animation is rendered and shown in the UI.

6. ✂️ **(Optional) Edit Tool**  
   Users can optionally view and tweak the generated code before rendering again  full control if you want it.
